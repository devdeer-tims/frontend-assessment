# DEVDEER Frontend Assessment

Check out the task [here](https://github.com/DEVDEER/Assessment/blob/main/frontend.md)

***This is the "advanced" implementation of the task which uses multiple components.***

To check out the basic implementation switch to the `main` branch [here](https://github.com/devdeer-tims/frontend-assessment/tree/main).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you need to select a node version (if you use `nvm`). I used node 21 (`nvm use 21`).

Second, install all dependencies using `npm install`.

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
